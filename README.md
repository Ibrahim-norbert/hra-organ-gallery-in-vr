Welcome to this repo! The Human Reference Atlas (HRA) Organ Gallery ([https://humanatlas.io/vr-organ-gallery](https://humanatlas.io/vr-organ-gallery)) lets the user explore 55 human organs and 100s of tissue blocks (as of the HRA v1.3), presented in real-world size and 3D. The organ models were developed to map trillions of cells for the [Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)](https://commonfund.nih.gov/hubmap). 

## Organs
To download the most up to date GLB files for the organs of the HRA, please use this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cns-iu/hra-glb-download). 

## Become a test user

If you would like to become a **test user**, please email Andreas Bueckle at [abueckle@iu.edu](mailto:abueckle@iu.edu). Information for testers can be found [here](INFORMATION_FOR_TESTERS.MD).

For more information about the Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) used to map tissue blocks from 100s of donors to single reference organs, see the Human Reference Atlas Portal at [https://humanatlas.io/](https://humanatlas.io/).

# HRA Organ Gallery

Welcome to this repo! The HRA Organ Gallery lets the user explore 55 human organs, journeying from the whole body, to the organ, to the tissue block, presented in real-world size and 3D. The organ models were developed to map trillions of cells for the [Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)](https://commonfund.nih.gov/hubmap). 

For more information about the Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) used to map tissue blocks from 100s of donors to single reference organs, see the HuBMAP CCF Portal at [https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/).
